### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a new 'Public Harmony' regulation mandates that all family meals must include a stranger from a different economic tier, observed through Lee's eyes during a Goh family dinner.
- Draft the internal memo from the Ministry of Urban Harmony announcing a new policy: 'Emotional Space Rationing,' where displays of grief, joy, or frustration are taxed based on duration and decibel level.
- Create a monologue from Old Mrs. Chua as she witnesses the balcony partitions being removed, weaving her story of the 'great flood' with the new 'volumetric equity.'
- Write a job listing for Elysian Fields Memorials seeking a 'Posthumous Presence & Legacy Fulfillment Associate,' detailing the absurd qualifications and clauses.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Volumetric Equity Calculator' web tool where users input their apartment details and it calculates their air tax, social catwalk exposure score, and potential fines.
- Design a speculative interface for Lee's 'ghost' work tablet, showing his schedule of performances, client scripts, and a real-time map of Ministry spatial realignments affecting his commute.
