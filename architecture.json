The scene captures the architectural class warfare: the ghost's form is pierced by the sleek lines of a billionaire's penthouse, while his feet dissolve into the vibrant, chaotic street market below. This is the commodification of memory and postcolonial absurdity; his performative identity is a service, and the living residents in the towering windows are blurred, anonymous performers in their own gold-plated cages. The composition is a vertical slice of societal strata, a haunting portrait of a professional ghost realizing he is the only free entity in a system where even the air is rented."
